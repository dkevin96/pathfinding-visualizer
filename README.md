## Key Features
- Real-time visualization of popular pathfinding algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Interactive grid environment with:
  - Adjustable start and end points
  - Ability to draw and erase wall obstacles

- User-friendly interface allowing:
  - Algorithm selection
  - Speed control for visualization
  - Clear and reset functionality

## Motivation

Being new to frontend web development, this project is an outlet for me to apply the web development knowledge.

Furthermore, I have a personal interest in learning and understanding how different algorithms work, building a pathfinding visualizer helps to reinforce my understanding of them.

To provide a platform that:

- runs and visualize search algorithms,
- highlights the differences between the search algorithms, and
- make learning about search algorithms more engaging through interactive elements.

## Built With

- React JS
- React Hooks, Context
